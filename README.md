### Hi there 👋

I'm a research computational biologist at [Enveda Therapeutics](https://envedatherapeutics.com/) and I work with biological knowledge graphs, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to identify active molecules and to deconvolute their mechanisms of action.

🧰 My Projects 🧰

- 🧬 [Biological Expression Language (BEL)](https://biological-expression-language.github.io/): a domain specific language for representing molecular biology
- 🌶️ [PyBEL](https://github.com/pybel): the computational ecosystem for compiling, querying, and analyzing knowledge graphs envoded in BEL
- 🤖 [PyKEEN](https://github.com/pykeen): knowledge graph embedding models for humans

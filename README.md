### Hi there 👋

I work with biological knowledge graphs, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to identify active molecules and to deconvolute their mechanisms of action.

🧰 My Projects

- 📮 [Bioregistry](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry): an integrative registry of biological databases, ontologies, and nomenclatures.
- 🧬 [Biological Expression Language (BEL)](https://biological-expression-language.github.io/): a domain specific language for representing molecular biology
- 🌶️ [PyBEL](https://github.com/pybel): the computational ecosystem for compiling, querying, and analyzing knowledge graphs encoded in BEL
- 📛 [PyOBO](https://github.com/pyobo): making ontologies and semantics accessible
- 🤖 [PyKEEN](https://github.com/pykeen): knowledge graph embedding models for humans 

⚖️ My Core Scientific Values

- ♻️ Reproducibility: code is part of the scientific process. It should be documented and re-usable by anyone.
- 🔓 Openness: science is best when people can build on each others' work. Sharing data, code, and ideas has benefitted everyone, and is also the responsiblity of a scientist to pay forward.
- 🎯 Thoroughness: quality is dependent on taking great care throughout all steps
